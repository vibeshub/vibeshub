# vibeshub — Claude Code + Codex + Cursor plugin

Uploads your Claude Code, Codex, or Cursor conversation trace to vibeshub
whenever you create or update a PR (or push the branch), and posts a comment on
the PR linking to the trace. Trace visibility mirrors the repository on GitHub:
public repos stay public, private repos stay private and are gated on the
viewer's GitHub access.

## Install

Inside Claude Code, add the vibeshub marketplace and install the plugin:

```
/plugin marketplace add vibeshub/vibeshub
/plugin install vibeshub@vibeshub
```

Claude Code resolves the `<owner>/<repo>` shorthand against GitHub and reads
[.claude-plugin/marketplace.json](../../.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) from
the repo — no clone required.

You'll also need:
- `gh` CLI, installed and authenticated (`gh auth login`) — your GitHub login
  is your vibeshub identity.
- `python3` 3.9+ on your `PATH` — Claude Code runs the hook with `python3`.
  The client uses only the Python standard library (plus a vendored
  [`truststore`](vibeshub_client/_vendor/README.md) on Python 3.10+ for OS-CA
  TLS verification), so there is nothing extra to `pip install`.

## Cursor

Cursor runs the same share logic through its own hook system, packaged as a
separate plugin generated from this one by `scripts/sync-cursor-plugin.py` and
published at [vibeshub/vibeshub-cursor](https://github.com/vibeshub/vibeshub-cursor).

Install **vibeshub** from the Cursor marketplace, then Reload Window.

To install without the marketplace (local development or air-gapped machines),
symlink the generated plugin tree into Cursor's local plugins directory:

```
ln -s /path/to/vibeshub-cursor ~/.cursor/plugins/local/vibeshub-cursor
```

Enable Settings → Features → "Include third-party Plugins, Skills, and other
configs", then Reload Window.

Either way, an `afterShellExecution` hook runs the plugin's share script after a
`git push`, tagged with `VIBESHUB_PLATFORM=cursor`. It reads the Cursor agent
transcript from `~/.cursor/projects/<project>/agent-transcripts/<id>/`
(including any subagents) and uploads it the same way. Cursor transcripts record
the conversation and tool calls but not tool outputs, token counts, or the model
name, so those fields are blank in the viewer.

## Configure

| Env var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VIBESHUB_SERVER_URL` | `https://vibeshub.ai` | Override for self-hosting |
| `VIBESHUB_HOOK_LOG` | `~/.vibeshub/hook.log` | Where the hook appends its per-invocation log |

## How it works

After every Bash tool call, a `PostToolUse` hook runs. If the command contained
`gh pr create`, `gh pr edit`, or `git push`, the hook:

1. Locates this session's transcript at
   `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-id>.jsonl`, plus any subagent
   transcripts spawned in git worktrees from the same session.
2. Runs client-side redaction over the JSONL (AWS keys, GitHub tokens, OpenAI
   keys, Anthropic keys, JWTs, env-style assignments, and high-entropy tokens).
3. Resolves the target PR — from `gh pr create`'s stdout, or by looking up the
   current branch's open PR for `git push` / `gh pr edit`.
4. Uploads to vibeshub using your `gh auth token` for identity. TLS is verified
   against the OS trust store (Python 3.10+) so the upload works on networks
   behind a TLS-intercepting proxy whose root CA the OS already trusts.
5. On the first upload for a PR, posts a `gh pr comment` linking to the
   trace. Subsequent updates refresh the same trace in place.

Installing the plugin is consent for upload. To stop uploading, uninstall the
plugin or remove the hook entry from your Claude Code settings. After-the-fact
deletion of any trace is available via
`/share-trace delete <pr-url | /t/<id> url | short-id>`.

## Manual share command

`/share-trace` lets you upload manually (e.g., the hook didn't run, or you want
to re-share after fixing something) or delete an existing trace. Without
arguments it picks the best target automatically:

1. An open PR you authored on the current branch — the trace is attached to that
   PR and a PR comment is posted.
2. Otherwise, if you are inside a git repo with a GitHub remote, the trace is
   attached to that repo (no PR).
3. Otherwise, a standalone public trace; you can switch it to private from the
   trace page in the vibeshub UI.

Forms:

- `/share-trace` — auto-detect per the order above
- `/share-trace <pr-url-or-number>` — share a specific PR
- `/share-trace delete <pr-url | pr-number | /t/<id> url | short-id>` — delete a
  trace. A bare number is always treated as a PR number.

In Codex, plugin skills are surfaced as namespaced slash entries. Use the
vibeshub skill entry:

- `/vibeshub:share-trace` — auto-detect per the order above
- `/vibeshub:share-trace <pr-url-or-number>` — share a specific PR
- `/vibeshub:share-trace delete <pr-url | pr-number | /t/<id> url | short-id>` —
  delete a trace. A bare number is always treated as a PR number.

If you type `/share-trace` in Codex, ask Codex to run the
`vibeshub:share-trace` skill; the un-namespaced Claude command wrapper is not
used by Codex.

## Privacy

Traces attached to a **public** GitHub repo (and standalone traces) default to
public; traces attached to a **private** repo are private and gated on the
viewer's GitHub repo-read access. Two redaction passes (client + server) catch
known secret patterns, but neither is a guarantee. You can delete any trace
after the fact via
`/share-trace delete <pr-url | /t/<id> url | short-id>`.
